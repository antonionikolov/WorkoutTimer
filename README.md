# WorkoutTimer
This is a simple timer for trainings which have circular flow.

You can set up:
* how many rounds you want to do
* how many exercises you want to do each round
* time for each exercise
* time for rest between exercises
* time for rest between rounds

The timer shows the current state of the training (round, exercise, rest and long rest).

### Future development
The timer can be set up so the user can input different timing for different exercises and the names of those exercises.
With this data the application will show to the user a proper information about what he have to do.
Also for better orintation for the user (if he is not looking at the screen) when to workout and when to rest, to the application can be added a sound for each state.
